### Strategies:
* Buy and Hold: Buy at the beginning of the time period and hold until the end of the time period
* Moving Average: Buy and sell based on the difference between the moving average of the recent price and current price
* Momentum: Buy if the instrument is on an increasing streak and sell if it is on a decreasing streak
* Reverse Momentum: Buy if the instrument is on a decreasing streak and sell if it is on a increasing streak
